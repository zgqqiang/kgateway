# Test Overview
- Internet needed for tests to run
- All upgrade tests run twice.
    - current minor last patch -> current code (ex: 1.12.3 -> 1.12.4)
    - previous minor latest patch -> current code (ex 1.11.latest -> 1.12.4)
- Each upgrade test installs gloo, upgrades CRDs and then upgrades gloo
- Each test runs a data setup and validation on installation of gloo and on upgrade of gloo

# Running Tests
- You will need to generate the `_test` and `_output` folders in order to run these tests locally
  - running [./hack/kind/setup-kind.sh](/hack/kind/setup-kind.sh) is an easy way to set up your environment to run the tests
- If you are debugging and cancel the test early there may be leftover pods and namespace resources, these commands can help clean things up for you

# remove gloo-system namespace resources and crds
```
kubectl delete ns gloo-system && kubectl delete crd --all
```

# delete old roles and bindings
You may not need to run all of these as some roles are only created for enterprise installations
```
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding,clusterrole -l app=gloo
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding,clusterrole -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=gloo
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding,clusterrole -l app=glooe-prometheus
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding,clusterrole -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=gloo-ee
```

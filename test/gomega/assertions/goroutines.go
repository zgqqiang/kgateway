// GoRoutineMonitor is a helper for monitoring goroutine leaks in tests
// This is useful for individual tests and does not need `t *testing.T` which is unavailable in ginkgo tests
//
// It also allows for more fine-grained control over the leak detection by allowing arguments to be passed to the
//`ExpectNoLeaks` function, in order to allow certain "safe" or expected goroutines to be ignored
//
// The use of `Eventually` also makes this routine useful for tests that may have a delay in the cleanup of goroutines,
// such as when `cancel()` is called, and the next test should not be started until all goroutines are cleaned up
//
// Example usage:
// BeforeEach(func() {
//	monitor := NewGoRoutineMonitor()
//	...
// }
//
// AfterEach(func() {
//  monitor.ExpectNoLeaks(helpers.CommonLeakOptions...)
// }

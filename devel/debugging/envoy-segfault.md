# Envoy Segmentation Fault

When a segmentation fault occurs in the proxy pod running Envoy, the stack trace is not visible. If you are running Gloo Gateway Enterprise, replace the default docker image in that pod with the debug replica:

Original Image:
```bash
$(IMAGE_REGISTRY)/gloo-ee-envoy-wrapper:$(VERSION)
```

Updated Image:
```bash
$(IMAGE_REGISTRY)/gloo-ee-envoy-wrapper:$(VERSION)-debug
```

This new image should emit more information about the segmentation fault. 

Please note that Envoy seg faults are considered a security risk, and therefore, you should follow the [steps to notify Solo.io of a security issue](/devel/contributing/issues.md#security-issues)
